# Old p5js projects
Just some projects (mostly retro game clones) made in [p5js](https://p5js.org), I'm archiving them on github because they've been sitting on google drive for far too long.

Honestly, they might not all work, idk, and the coding style and whatnot is pretty awful.

To run them just go into a subfolder and run the .html file in a web browser
